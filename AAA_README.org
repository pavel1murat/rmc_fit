 *building and running:*

  1. clone rmc_fit to a release area which has STNTUPLE (any version >= v7_2_0 tag,
     which has 'smooth' class added) checked out

     git clone https://github.com/pavel1murat/rmc_fit.git

  2. assuming mu2e environment has been setup, simply run scons to build the library:

     scons 

  3. to run a kMax scan for a given spectrum:

     root.exe
     .L lib/librmc_fit_ana.so
     r = new rmc_fit()
     r->scan(1992,"Al","1998",85,95,20)

    see rmc_fit/ana/ana/rmc_fit.hh for the interface, it is more or less self-explanatory


  4. how to plot a particular data set:

     rmc_data::Data_t data;
     rmc_data* x = new rmc_data();
     x->get_experimental_data(1995,"Al",0,&data)
     data.fHist->Draw();

  4. *More details*
  ----------------

  4.1 a spectrum to fit is specified by a year and a nuclear target
      see rmc_fit/ana/rmc_data.cc  (rmc_data::get_experiments_data)
      for the list of avalable year/target combinations

  4.2 the response is either "1992" or "1998" (tagged by the publication year),
      it chooses the response function

  4.3 year: 1991, 1995
